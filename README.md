# flutter-app
My first introduction to flutter. I followed a couple of beginner tutorials on the flutter website, to create a counter app and a name generator app. Then, I was given `task_management.zip` which contains a set of to-do list items that I was tasked with displaying and organising onto an app `my_task_management` on a mobile-sized device that could be used in a warehouse to organise and allocate tasks to individuals.

Much of the project was looking through the flutter documentation, in order to interpret the building block files I was given and then adding my own code to the scripts. Essentially I was learning dart for the first while simultaneously trying to build the app.
